Whichever path you choose should align with what you value most, and it can also help to seek advice from trusted medical and financial professionals to understand potential outcomes.", "5": "You’ve shared that financial independence is especially important to you, even when facing a serious medical condition. This is a deeply personal value, and different people might approach this decision differently based on their own priorities.
